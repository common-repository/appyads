AppyAds helps website and mobile application owners to publish advertisements on their platforms. 

== Description ==

If you would like to publish advertisements on your website and potentially earn extra income by doing so, you can install the AppyAds WordPress plugin. The AppyAds plugin makes it easy to manage the placements of ads within the pages of your website. Using the provided widgets and shortcodes, you have complete control over where the ads are displayed.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress version 4.7 or greater
* PHP version 5.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles all the file transfers and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the AppyAds plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “AppyAds” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the AppyAds plugin, which is a software package contained in a zip file.  Once downloaded, the zip file needs to uploaded to your webserver via FTP or SFTP (your hosting provider can provide more details on how to upload files). The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
